        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Danylo Dunets (a.k.a. I-Human) is a Ukrainian composer from Mariupol
          who specializes in music for films, video games, and other media. I’m
          equally passionate about creating music in a wide range of genres —
          from dramatic orchestral scores to dark electronic soundscapes, always
          focused on crafting atmospheric and emotional compositions and
          memorable musical themes. I collaborate closely with directors and
          designers to transform their ideas and feedback into music that
          supports the game’s vision. I love music in all its forms — listening
          to it, exploring it, creating it. For me, it’s neither a profession
          nor a hobby, but a way of living and seeing the world — an essential
          part of who I am.
